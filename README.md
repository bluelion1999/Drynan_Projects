# Welcome!
My name is Bryce Drynan and I  have just completed my Master of Science in Business Analytics at Wake Forest's School of Business. Prior to my Master's I graduated from Southern Connecticut State University with a degree in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Data Science. During the summer of 2022, I went to Auburn University where I was an REU participant researching abstract algebra and graph theory. After that summer I wanted to shift my interests from theoretical to practical and apply what I have learned. I hope to have a career where I can blend my technical skills with communication and storytelling to convey the underlying secrets that data has to offer!
