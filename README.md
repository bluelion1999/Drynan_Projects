# Welcome!
My name is Bryce Drynan and I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics student at Wake Forest's School of Business. I graduated from Southern Connecticut State University with a degree in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Data Science. During the summer of 2022, I went to Auburn University where I was an REU participant researching abstract algebra and graph theory. After that summer I wanted to shift my interests from theoretical to practical and apply what I have learned leading me to Wake. My interests are in Data Analytics and Data Science where I hope to have a career!
